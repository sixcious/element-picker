## Important Note
ElemPick contains some experimental ideas and features. Unfortunately, this means it might contain a few bugs and it might not work on every website you try it on! But I really want you to be 100% happy with it, so if something isn't working right, or if there's a feature you think is missing, please feel free to open an issue and give me a chance to fix it and I promise I will.

## FAQ

#### What is the minimum browser version (and why is it to so high)?
ElemPick currently requires Chrome/Edge `120` and Firefox `128` and higher to run. I usually update the minimum browser version every time I do a release so I can use the latest and greatest ECMAScript features without worry. If your browser doesn't support ElemPick, I'm afraid you'll have to use another app/extension (sorry!).

#### Where's the source code?
Because it's still very new, ElemPick is currently proprietary. I do want to make it open source in the future, though (I thank you for your understanding).

#### Why is the production version's source code minified?
I use [Terser](https://github.com/terser/terser) to minify the source code for production releases that I upload to your browser's web store. I mainly do this because I write a lot of comments and `console.log()` statements for debugging and because it cuts down the file size significantly. That said, you can always view a "Pretty Print" of the source code by using a [CRX Viewer](https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/) to inspect it before installing it.
